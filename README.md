# Superstore — Sales Analysis

## About
Superstore is a near-realistic synthetic sales dataset (~10,000 records). This project demonstrates end-to-end analysis: data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, KPI calculation, and visual storytelling to surface trends and business insights. Data cleaning and analysis were performed in Python (`pandas`, `numpy`), with `pandasql` used for SQL-style queries when helpful. Dashboards and visualizations were created in Tableau to support stakeholder-facing insights.

## Technologies
- Python (pandas, numpy)  
- SQL (pandasql)  
- Tableau  
- Excel

## Key deliverables
- Cleaned and validated dataset for reliable reporting.  
- KPI definitions and calculations to monitor sales performance.  
- Interactive Tableau dashboards highlighting regional, segment, and temporal trends.  
- Written 15 SQL queries answering business questions.

## Highlights / Findings
- California contributed the highest sales across years, with total revenue above $700K in 2018.
